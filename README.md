## Importance of Nitrogen:
Nitrogen is an important element for agricultural productivity because it is one of the most limiting factors. Fertilizers are applied to improve crop productivity; however, the plant doesnâ€™t uptake all the applied fertilizer into the soil. Also, nitrogen is a mobile element, and it often can be leached out of the soil and transported to water bodies. Excessive nitrogen can cause environmental problems, such as the death zone in the Gulf of Mexico. Therefore, it is essential to not over-fertilize field corps.

Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is a term used to help control the over-application of N fertilizers. NUE is a measurement of how efficiently a crop can uptake nitrogen. Usually, NUE is calculated as a ratio between the nitrogen uptake with the harvested crop and the nitrogen applied in the fertilizer.
